    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember when using subqueries is to provide some way for the reader to easily determine which parts of the query will be executed together. Most people do this by indenting the subquery in some way\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if we have a GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, HAVING, or any other statement following our subquery, we would then indent it at the same level as our outer query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below is similar to the above, but it is applying additional statements to the outer query, so you can see there are GROUP BY and ORDER BY statements used on the output are not tabbed. The inner query GROUP BY and ORDER BY statements are indented to match the inner table.\n",

    "### MORE on Subquery:\n",
    "\n",
    "Subqueries can be used in several places within a query, it can be used anywhere we might use a table name or even a column name or an individual value. \n",
    "* They are especially useful in conditional logic in conjunction with `Where` and `Join` clauses or in the `WHEN` portion of a `CASE` statement.\n",

    "### Expert Tip\n",
    "Note that you should not include an alias when you write a subquery in a conditional statement. This is because the subquery is treated as an individual value (or set of values in the IN case) rather than as a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice the query here compared a single value. If we returned an entire column IN would need to be used to perform a logical argument. If we are returning an entire table, then we must use an ALIAS for the table, and perform additional logic on the entire table.\n",

    "**EXERCISE**:\n",
    "\n",
