    "<h2>Formatting Best Practices..</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Upper and Lower Case in SQL:**<br>\n",
    "SQL queries can be run successfully whether characters are written in upper- or lower-case. In other words, SQL queries are not case-sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capitalizing SQL Clauses:**<br>It is common and best practice to capitalize all SQL commands, like `SELECT` and `FROM`, and keep everything else in your query lower case. Capitalizing command words makes queries easier to read, which will matter more as you write more complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One other note:**<BR> The text data stored in SQL tables can be either upper or lower case, and SQL is case-sensitive in regard to this text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Spaces in Table and Variable Names:**<br>\n",
    "It is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names. It is a bit annoying to work with spaces in SQL. In Postgres if you have spaces in column or table names, you need to refer to these columns/tables with double quotes around them (Ex: `FROM \"Table Name\"` as opposed to `FROM table_name`). In other environments, you might see this as square brackets instead (Ex: `FROM [Table Name]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use White Space in Queries:**<br>\n",
    "SQL queries ignore spaces, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as you want, and the queries are the same. But pls use with decorum.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Semicolons:**<br>\n",
    "Depending on your SQL environment, your query may need a semicolon at the end to execute. Other environments are more flexible in terms of this being a \"requirement.\" It is considered best practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple queries at once if your environment allows this."

    "\n",
