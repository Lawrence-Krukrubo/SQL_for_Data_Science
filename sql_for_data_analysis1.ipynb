    "<h3>Formatting Best Practices..</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Upper and Lower Case in SQL:**<br>\n",
    "SQL queries can be run successfully whether characters are written in upper- or lower-case. In other words, SQL queries are not case-sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capitalizing SQL Clauses:**<br>It is common and best practice to capitalize all SQL commands, like `SELECT` and `FROM`, and keep everything else in your query lower case. Capitalizing command words makes queries easier to read, which will matter more as you write more complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One other note:**<BR> The text data stored in SQL tables can be either upper or lower case, and SQL is case-sensitive in regard to this text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Spaces in Table and Variable Names:**<br>\n",
    "It is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names. It is a bit annoying to work with spaces in SQL. In Postgres if you have spaces in column or table names, you need to refer to these columns/tables with double quotes around them (Ex: `FROM \"Table Name\"` as opposed to `FROM table_name`). In other environments, you might see this as square brackets instead (Ex: `FROM [Table Name]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use White Space in Queries:**<br>\n",
    "SQL queries ignore spaces, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as you want, and the queries are the same. But pls use with decorum.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Semicolons:**<br>\n",
    "Depending on your SQL environment, your query may need a semicolon at the end to execute. Other environments are more flexible in terms of this being a \"requirement.\" It is considered best practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple queries at once if your environment allows this."

    "\n",
    "In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LIKE**<br>\n",
    "This allows you to perform operations similar to using `WHERE` and `=`, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IN**<br>\n",
    "This allows you to perform operations similar to using `WHERE` and `=`, but for more than one condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOT**<br>\n",
    "This is used with `IN` and `LIKE` to select all of the rows `NOT LIKE` or `NOT IN` a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AND & BETWEEN**<br>\n",
    "These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OR**<br>\n",
    "This allow you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The LIKE Operator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LIKE` operator is extremely useful for working with text. You will use `LIKE` within a `WHERE` clause. The `LIKE` operator is frequently used with `%`. The `%` tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use single quotes for the text you pass to the `LIKE` operator, because of this lower and uppercase letters are not the same within the string. Searching for 'T' is not the same as searching for 't'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The IN Operator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IN` operator is useful for working with both numeric and text columns. This operator allows you to use an `=`, but for more than one item of that particular column. We can check one, two or many column values for which we want to pull data, but all within the same query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The NOT Operator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NOT` operator is an extremely useful operator for working with the previous two operators we introduced: `IN` and `LIKE`. By specifying `NOT` `LIKE` or `NOT` `IN`, we can grab all of the rows that do not meet a particular criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expert Tip**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most SQL environments, although not in our Udacity's classroom, you can use single or double quotation marks - and you may NEED to use double quotation marks if you have an apostrophe within the text you are attempting to pull."
